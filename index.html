                <p class="">During my five month internship in Berlin I mostly helped with communication projects. Next to this I participated in the research team, where concepts for the smart-home were explored. My activities ranged from creating production-ready graphics, making concepts and storyboards for exhibitions and making interactive digital or physical prototypes for installations.</p>

                <p class="">ART+COM is an award winning new media design company. The studio, which was established in 1988, creates new media installations and spaces in three categories: Art, Communication and Research. The company is famous for its kinetic sculptures and experimental interactive installations. Other projects include interactive exhibitions: musea full with playful installations and cutting-edge interactive artefacts.</p>

This long term design project was reaching its end, therefore I primarily helped in making graphics and interfaces production ready. In the exhibition, interactive media installations teached visitors all about the invisible microscopic world. These installations ranged from large wall screens to kinect user interfaces and small kiosks with video and text.

					<h4>Speculative design: discarded phones as interfaces in the smart home</h4>
                    <p>The Smart Home field has been receiving attention from computer technologists and designers for some time already; the promise within closer reach of consumers every day. And while a smart home is filled with sensors, screens and chips, their presence should be attenuated — technology fades into the background as attention seeking notifications make way for calm interactions. This is made possible by ‘smart’ technology: interconnected devices that are able to think for us. The building blocks that make up a smart home are readily available, WiFi connected lights (Philips Hue) for example, and smart thermostats (Nest). But will connected devices ever gain mainstream adoption in the face of high costs and growing concerns over privacy?</p>
<p>Regardless, the house of the future means an explosion in electronics: a huge increase in the number of screens, chips and sensors, all able to connect to the Internet. But don’t we already have such devices lying around at home? Devices that are currently collecting dust? Old smartphones. Androids that can&#8217;t run the latest OS anymore, iPhones replaced by thinner ones or phones that weren&#8217;t worth the replacement of a cracked screen. These legacy devices may still work, they don’t meet our requirements for a smartphone anymore. So can we then, instead of fabricating new dedicated smart home devices, use the old phones that we don’t use but don’t throw away?</p>

                <img width="300" height="169" src="images/artcom/P1000135.jpg" class="attachment-blog-small" alt="The final prototype" />
            </ul>
<p>As part of my internship at ART+COM, I explored the idea of using legacy devices in a smart home. To make the concept more tangible, a quick prototype was made. The starting point of the prototype was an old iPhone 3GS a team member had lying around. This phone is well suited to running web apps, so a small webpage was quickly developed. To transform the iPhone into something other than a phone, a new phone case was made. The form was inspired by crochet ­­— a decoration often found in houses that has no association with technology. The shape was then 3D printed, with smaller details added by computer cut stickers.</p>
<p>The prototype functions as an ambient display, slowly changing its contents over time. It abstractly visualises data acquired either via its sensors or via other connected devices. The display also reacts to direct user interactions, changing contents when the user touches the screen. This illustrates how the user can always influence whatever the device is controlling or showing.</p>
<p>While this prototype doesn’t bring about any practical functionality, it does demonstrate what is possible with legacy phones. We should start making use of their limited specifications, which are still ample for dedicated tasks. Being able to try out smart home applications without needing to buy a new device, but only run an app and print a case, will definitely lower the threshold. Or when we go a step further and are able to create those apps ourselves in conjunction with a functional case, it could deliver an even better fit for our own smart homes’ needs. Is there any faster way to bring smart technology into people’s homes than utilising the electronics that are already present?</p>

                <p class="">In a project team of six, we all shared responsibility and roles throughout the half year project. Two of my main achievements were the functional prototype for the redesign and the final pitch video.

                <p class="">Bike computers are tiny devices that often boast about the large amount of functionalities they offer. This often poses a usability threat, as cyclists cannot concentrate on such a small device during cycling. By executing thorough user research on the current design, specific usability problems were uncovered. In a redesign the problems ranging from button accessibility, visual hierarchy and clear use-cues were addressed, which was verified by a second research session.</p>

                    <p>In order to verify the redesigned product, a prototype was needed to test with. Because the scale and mobility of a bike computer is important in how people use the device, we wanted to use a prototype that also had these characteristics. The odd shape of the screen together with the placement of the buttons, asked for a creative approach in making a functional prototype.  I lead the effort of making the prototype work by using Arduino hardware as input, an iPhone as output and a computer running Quartz Composer to make everything work together. The prototype put the research participants in control, while allowing observers to closely follow their actions remotely.</p>

                       <p>I started the project by doing lots of research. Talking to librarians, parents and architects, finding books and reports on the future of libraries, reading scientific articles and so on. This resulted in my own vision on the future of the library.</p>

                       <p>The useflow was desgined first. As the most important challenge was to get boys to sit down and read, the ideal intensity of physical activity and attention was modelled. When a kid enters the library, he's quite active, running around and exploring the space. This should be supported, therefore the physical activity increases. After a while, the energy drains and it's time to take a rest. This is the perfect moment for them to sit down and read a story. Meanwhile, their enthousiasm about the story should increase during the activity, in that way the kid will want to read it when it's time to rest. A soon as the book is openend, the story takes over, taking the child on a new journey.</p>

                <p class="">The idea has been in my head for quite a while (what else do you do at party's than think of new things?). When I told some DJ's about it, they were psyched and I created the first prototypes for them. After that I formed a small team with whom we started developing the product and business.</p>

              <div class="medium-7 medium-pull-5 columns">
                <p class="">The amount of DJ's nowadays is increasing rapiuly. Everyone is looking to make a living from their hobby, but how can they stand out from the crowd? This product provides the DJ with his own piece of interactive light equipment, which he can put on the backside of his laptop. In this way his instrument, the laptop, is visually linked with what the audience is hearing, creating a richer interaction with the crowd. The translation of music to visuals is done via a software application triggered by the music, therefore the DJ doesn't have to pay constant attention to the light. Don't think winamp visualizations, but more of a reflection of the musical journey the DJ takes you.</p>

The visuals on the product were created during the gig, by encoding a live video stream from a VJ application.</p>

                    <p>Extensive research was done on materials and electronics. To build the prototype, multiple tries were 3D printed and laser cut. On the software side, open source software and libraries have been implemented.</p>

We set out to bring him to the real world by building a flying carpet that actually works without magic, but with electronics and software. To fly it, you sit on the carpet and shift your weight to the front to fly forward. The segway-like mechatronics system keeps you from falling. To make a turn, the crystal ball can be rotated.</p>

During my internship Windows 10 was launched, including this application. Microsoft adapted a more agile way of developing for Windows 10, which is why features are developed constantly and quickly based on customer feedback. Right after the release, people asked for a new feature in the Photos app. They wanted to see their folders in their Photos collection. </p>

                <p class="">My main projects with VirtuaLock were designing its website and promotional materials. I've created offline and online marketing campaigns, in order to promote usage of Virtualock. Next to this I've been improving user experiences of the software, like making tutorials and tweaking the interface. </p>

                <p class="">Virtualock is an application that protects your laptop. When you are working in a (semi-) public space and need to leave your laptop, to get a coffee for example, you can activate virtualock and it will protect your laptop. When someone tries to steal the laptop, either by unplugging the cable, closing the lid or removing the battery, VirtuaLock will activate the alarm. A loud sounding alarm is player, the user gets a text message and surrounding people are notified through a popup message.</p>
                <p>Currently VirtuaLock is licensed by five universities in the Netherlands, providing the students with a free subscription on VirtuaLock.</p>

                <p class="">Endeavour is a windows phone app concept that lets you finish tasks. By focussing on small tasks and making them relevant on the time you check your phone, it is assured that the task is really done. Resulting in a more productive day. The app has three categories: think, make and check, as these require a different state of mind and thus can be more relative on a particular moment. In order to keep the user aware of his surroundings and get away from the phone, random assignments are put into the task list as well.</p>

                <p class="">This short documentary is made to inspire people from Istanbul to reuse products. By setting myself as an example. I show how easy it is to find discarded resources and then transform them into useful objects. Being a foreigner who hasn’t been in Istanbul for long, doesn’t speak the language and knows almost nothing about the city, it should be hard. So if I succeeded, people living in Istanbul can almost certainly succeed in reusing products and doing DIY.</p>

                      <p>After watching this <a href="http://vimeo.com/56895190" target="_blank">inspirational video</a>, about reusing found resources to make new furniture, we got in touch with its maker, a Dutch university exchange student taking a &#39;Design For Social Innovation&#39; course, given by &Ccedil;iğdem Kaya, here in Istanbul to find out about the motivation behind it.</p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>First of all, can you tell us a little about yourself and what brought you to Istanbul?&nbsp;</strong></p>
                      <p>
                        I&#39;m Jip Eilbracht and I&#39;m 21 years old. I&#39;m from the Netherlands, where I&rsquo;m currently studying, in my 3rd year of Industrial Design Engineering at the Technical University in Delft. In your 3rd year you have the chance to do any study programme you want at your own or a different university for 5 months. I saw it as a chance to live in a different country and experience a different kind of life for a while. Istanbul attracted me because it&#39;s quite an unfamiliar place for me and a lot of other people, even though it&#39;s not that far from the Netherlands. I had also visited it once and had a very good experience. I think as an Erasmus student you can have a great time in any city, but Istanbul is such an interesting place in terms of culture, things that happen, and how people live - it can open up your vision.</p>

                      <p>
                        <strong>Your video touches on the problem of second-hand stores in trendy neighborhoods, which is that their costs often come close or exceed those of new products. The past is obviously a great source of inspiration for this generation, but at what point do second-hand goods lose their worth?</strong></p>
                      <p>
                        I mostly see second-hand shops as places where you can get loads of different stuff very cheaply, just like a second-hand market place online. You are very happy when you&#39;ve found a real gem, at a very low price, but it comes at the cost of a long search. The second-hand shops in Cihangir are more focused on a certain lifestyle and act as kind of curators. They do the long search and find the gem, but at the cost of the price you pay. A lot of people find this very convenient and easy, that&#39;s why these shops exist. But to me, being a real Dutch person, buying something&nbsp;doesn&#39;t feel that good when I paid too much for it. The real joy is to find something cheap when it&rsquo;s as good, or better than new stuff.</p>

                      <p>
                        <strong>Having cheaply furnished your room, what tips would you give people who want to do the same?&nbsp;</strong></p>
                      <p>
                        One of the ways in which I found some useable stuff was to just walk around my neighborhood. Keeping my eyes open, talking to people (as far as I could talk with them) and finding out whether they have things they don&rsquo;t need or want anymore, but might be still be useable. If you find stuff on the streets, don&rsquo;t be afraid when they&rsquo;re a bit dirty or not so good looking. You&rsquo;ll be amazed with what a small piece of sandpaper or a lick of paint can do.&nbsp;</p>

                      <p>
                        If you really want to get started, invest a little bit in hand tools. They always come in useful, and you can lend them out to friends when they&rsquo;re doing the same. I&rsquo;m sure that in Karak&ouml;y for example, you can get some good deals on tools. Also remember that it&#39;s nice to have things in quantity. One wooden crate brings you nothing, but you can make a nice closet if you&#39;ve got 10 of them.</p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>There are great deals to be had in and around Cihangir, Beyoğlu, etc. if people leave behind certain second-hand stores and seek out places where locals do their shopping. Do you have any recommendations for people shopping on a budget in Istanbul?</strong></p>
                      <p>
                        I was surprised to find a shopping mall on the Istiklal with tens of shops with very cheap quality clothes. I&rsquo;m not sure of the name, but it&rsquo;s somewhere opposite of SALT, underneath a pretty fancy restaurant. So that&#39;s a good one to visit when you are in need of clothes or just want to do some shopping.</p>

                      <p>
                        For food there&#39;s of course the Tarlabaşı Sunday market, where you will find plenty of other locals and Erasmus students who are doing their food shopping. Or when you&#39;re looking for a nice breakfast get a cheap fully-filled sandwich from a street cart around Taksim square and find a nice place to sit and enjoy. Maybe another thing which can be seen as a great deal are the Cihangir steps. With a low-price beer from a supermarket, you get the same view over Istanbul as all the top-notch terraces. How&#39;s that for a cheap evening out?!</p>

                      <p>
                        <strong>Cihangir is one of Istanbul&rsquo;s most cosmopolitan neighborhoods. Is it managing to retain its local flavor, or is Cihangir simply becoming aligned with other like-minded neighborhoods in cities across Europe and North America?</strong></p>
                      <p>
                        As for as the few places I&#39;ve visited in other countries, I agree that Cihangir is a very cosmopolitan neighborhood. It&#39;s one of the few areas in Istanbul where a lot of people in restaurants and shops can speak English, in a non-touristic way. I always found it such an interesting place to be, because it&#39;s so different from the bordering neighborhoods, in a positive way. The streets are greener and more modern, with a lot of quiet areas. But if you look at all the fancy places you can go to, you clearly see they got some inspiration from other cities.</p>

                      <p>
                        <strong>We may think that the city should work towards making urban living more affordable, but there has been such an influx of money into Istanbul recently that it may seem futile for them to cater to the less wealthy residents. What are some of the ways people in Istanbul can make urban living more affordable?</strong></p>
                      <p>
                        One of the trends which I spotted is that a lot of Turkish people order (fast) food from home. This is actually quite an expensive way of eating every day. As a student, I&rsquo;m used to cooking for myself and others. In Istanbul and Turkey, food is very cheap if you compare it to the rest of Europe. If you buy your food from the weekly markets, it&rsquo;s almost as if you get it for free! Even though the quality is super. So to make your living more affordable, I would suggest using your kitchen more often and be on the lookout for markets in your neighborhood.&nbsp;</p>

                      <p>
                        Regarding furniture, it might be a bit hard to compete with IKEA or Ko&ccedil;tas, even when you scavenge a lot on the street and buy parts yourself. What I think is that you can get a more personal environment you live in, instead of living in a catalogue. But perhaps that&rsquo;s a bit out of the scope of this question.&nbsp;</p>

                      <p>
                        <strong>Istanbul is filled with objects from its past, but people face a lot of pressure to embrace new objects into their lives.&nbsp;What message would you give to the people of Istanbul, in terms of using what already exists?</strong></p>
                      <p>
                        Of course there&rsquo;s a lot of pressure on everybody to buy new products. It&rsquo;s in almost every company&rsquo;s interest that you buy something new instead of using something which already exists, or being content with what you have. A way in which you can counteract this influence of marketing is to look around and be inspired by what other people are doing. I made this video to inspire other people from Istanbul to do the same, give them some ideas of what can be possible. There are so many other people doing this, showing what you can do with things which already exist; on the internet, local communities or even the people in your own surroundings. If you know what&rsquo;s possible and where to start, the next idea of what you can make might just pop into your head.&nbsp;</p>

                      <p>
                        <strong>Why do you think there is a stigma around urban scavenging? How can people be educated in order to convince them that recycling means more than throwing our bottles and cans in appropriately labeled bins?</strong></p>
                      <p>
                        The first time I found some wooden crates and brought them home to make something of, my Turkish flatmates asked me why I collected trash. After making a closet from the wooden crates, they still weren&rsquo;t convinced that it was suited for furniture. I think using waste material for new things has got a stigma because it&rsquo;s something &lsquo;other people do&rsquo;. If you live in a proper house and you have the money to buy a closet for 80 Liras, you&rsquo;ll do it. If you have some chairs you don&rsquo;t need anymore, you put them out for the garbage man. Consumers need to be more conscious about what they&rsquo;re doing and more active in their way of living. Maybe your neighbor can use some chairs, or even use the wood from them.&nbsp;</p>

                      <p>
                        During my studies at the ITU we discussed a lot about design and DIY, how we can get people to be their own designers. I think the point is for everyone to be their own designer. The knowledge an industrial designer has got in terms of creativity, materials and how to build things needs to be easy accessible to more people. In that way, consumers can have the ability to think of a new use for their old closet and a better knowledge on how to build something new in a good way.</p>

                        With regards to my flatmates; after they helped me with this video and saw the result, they really changed their perspective. Now they know those old products I collected aren&rsquo;t trash, but can be used for something in their house!&nbsp;</p>

                <p class="">I've been experimenting a lot with live video. Using camera's, videomixers, DVD's and computer inputs to create a new moving image, that corrosponds with the music or act at play.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="medium-7 medium-pull-5 columns">
                <p class="">With VJ'ing, live video is mixed on the spot. Whether that's in a club at a party, or during a open air festival. During my time as A VJ I've created my own video loop library with hundreds of self-made animations and video's. By mixing them and applying effects, they provide an enuless resource for live visuals.</p>
